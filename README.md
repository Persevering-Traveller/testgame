# Details
A simple platformer game using GrafxKid's [Open Game Art](https://opengameart.org/content/arcade-platformer-assets) and [Pygame-CE](https://github.com/pygame-community/pygame-ce).
This project is a way to familiarize myself with the Python language, and creating a platformer game using only a library.
